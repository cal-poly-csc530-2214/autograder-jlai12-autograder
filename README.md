# HW 5: Autograder

### 1. Read through paper(s):
* [_Automated feedback generation for introductory programming assignments_  (Singh et al. 2013)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2491956.2462195)
* [_The Sketching Approach to Program Synthesis_ (Solar-Lezama 2009)](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/papers/Solar-Lezama09.pdf)
* This feels a bit silly to keep including this, but it's in my template!
    
### 2. Sketch:
 * Installation & setup via guide on [Armando Solar-Lezama's hompage](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/) (thank you Joe!)
 * Worked through several examples from the [Sketch Programmers Manual](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/manual.pdf)
 * Worked through a general example of "replace `value` with either `value - 1` or `value + 1`"  
 * Interesting to note how many transformations/optimizations are applied to the original code (on par with 
    what I might expect from a compiler). I suppose doing so really helps keep the search spaces for the holes
    as constrained as possible.
